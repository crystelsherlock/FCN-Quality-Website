<h3>Issues, Ideas?</h3>

<h3>Color Legend</h3>
<p>
<span style="color:#c5b0d5; background:#9467bd; padding:4px; border-radius: 4px;">Provider</span>
<span style="color:#ffbb78; background:#ff7f0e; padding:4px; border-radius: 4px;">Clinic</span>
<span style="color:#aec7e8; background:#1f77b4; padding:4px; border-radius: 4px;">FCN</span>

<h3>Strip Chart</h3>
<p>Shows the distribution of all provider panels at FCN with the individual provider highlighted.</p>
<img src="../strip_chart.png" width="176" height="239" style="display:block" class="uk-align-center">
<p>Here you can see that the provider's panel is doing better than most at FCN. You can also see there's a wide range of panels &mdash;
typically that means this quality measure is more difficult for us.</p>
<h3>Quality Comet Chart</h3>
<p>The 'quality comets' show how individual panels are changing over time. The tail shows size and direction of changes. If there's no tail, then there hasn't been significant change.</p>
<img src="../quality_comet.png" width="339" height="169" style="display:block" class="uk-align-center">
<p>Here you can see that 3 provider panels have dramatically improved. Several are doing a little improvement and a few are mostly unchanged. Looking that the height of the dots, you can see most are above target &mdash; so there has probably been some work and learning on this quality measure.</p>
